# Machine learning methods reveal processes affecting abundance at multiple scales: A commentary on 'Global and regional drivers of abundance patterns in the hart's tongue fern complex (Aspleniaceae)'

We live in an era characterized by unprecedented levels of human-driven extinction.
The only way to mitigate this damage is to simultaneously document biodiversity while determining the processes that generate it.
This endeavour is extremely difficult first due to the large amounts of data required and second because of the complex and intertwined nature of ecology; we can rarely ascribe one predominant effect that determines the distribution of species.
In this issue of *Annals of Botany*, @Heo2022 combine dense sampling on a global scale with recently developed machine learning methods to gain insight into the processes governing abundance of the Hart's tongue fern.
Abundance is a key parameter for understanding the distribution of biodiversity, as it governs the existence of local populations and ultimately species; gaining a better understanding of the processes governing abundance is critical to conserving biodiversity in the Anthropocene.

*Asplenium scolopendrium*, or Hart's Tongue Fern (HTF), is a widely distributed fern species complex with three major centers, in North America, Europe, and Asia.
It shows different patterns of abundance in each, with patchily distributed populations of smaller size in North America, dense populations in Europe, and __ in Asia.
Furthermore, these have been relatively well collected, with thousands of occurrence records available in GBIF.
Thus, HTF is an excellent system for understanding the processes affecting abundance of species on a global as well as local level.

<!-- Integration across scales -->

It is likely that processes occurring simultaneously at multiple scales interact to determine abundance.
At broad (global) scales, climate change operates to shift species distributions primarily along latitudinal gradients.
Changes in land use by humans also operates to influence species distributions at large scales.
Within these larger forces, processes acting at the regional to local scale such as distribution of soil type and local climate further influence species distribution and abundance.
The complex and interwoven nature of these processes has long been an impediment to understanding how they work in practice.
However, Heo et al. were able to use a type of powerful machine learning, boosted regression tree (BRT) models, in combination with their dense sampling to overcome this difficulty.

<!-- A different paradigm for understanding ecology -->

Mathematical models have long been a key tool for understanding ecology.
Classic models in ecology start by defining a reasonable model for a given phenomenon, then seek to fit the parameters of the model to the data.
While such classic models are straightforward to interpret, they often have relatively low explanatory power.
This is due to the extremely complex nature of ecology, which includes many interacting processes across multiple scales.
Machine learning approaches, on the other hand, do not start from a particular model; rather, they attempt to learn the relationship between predictors and response variables via iterative algorithms.
While this is a promising approach for understanding ecological processes, it has not been widely applied, perhaps due to the dominant statistical paradigm of ecology that has focused on explanation rather than prediction.
@Heo2022 used a type of machine learning called boosted regression trees (BRT), which combine a large number of simple regression trees to obtain a robust prediction.
Their BRT model included variables at both global (e.g., magnitude of past climate change, anthropogenic impacts) and regional (topography, edaphic conditions, local climate) scales.
The BRT model is well suited such an analysis including interacting variables at multiple scales as it is non-parametric and insensitive to outliers; furthermore, any potential interactions are accounted for during the learning process and do not need to be specified *a-priori*.

<!-- Different continents, different processes -->

One clear factor influencing abundance identified by @Heo2022 was population isolation (measured as distance to the nearest other population), which was the most important variable across all four regions.
Interestingly, population isolation was relatively less important in North America, where populations tend to be restricted to scattered microhabitats, compared to Europe or Asia, where populations tend to be more contiguous.
It could be that distances between North American populations is greater than the typical dispersal ability of HTF.
In contrast, populations in Europe and Asia may often be subject to the "rescue effect", whereby propagules from neighboring populations are able to replenish a low-abundance population otherwise in danger of extirpation.

Furthermore, @Heo2022 found that the next most important variables after population isolation varied across regions: precipitation seasonality was most important in Europe, whereas precipitation heterogeneity and past climate change were most important in Asia and North America, respectively.
Again, these differences make sense in light of what is known about the geographic context of each area.
Hotspots of HTF abundance in Asia are often on mountainous islands with steep climatic gradients, whereas the flora of North America has been strongly affected by movement of glaciers.
